            <pre>
                She got a pretty face, pretty waist, she's a dinner plate
                She's the reason that my heart gon' break if she walk away
                How you look good from the back like this?
                Eyes got a heart so I rap like this
                She held it down 'til I turned to a prince
                Now I'm a king, baby, look at the wrist   
            </pre>

            <pre>
                Shawty so bad, she blushed when I said it
                Niggas got mad 'cause they heard that I'm trending
                Yeezy 350s, I want it, go get it
                Look at this jewellery, I look like I'm selling
                Instagram warriors, these niggas be flexing
                Caught him in person, now he acting different
                20 years old, but I'll soon buy a mansion
                Kids from back home gonna say I'm a legend, ayy
            </pre>
